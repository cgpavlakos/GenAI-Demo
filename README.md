# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š LlamaIndex - RAG Chat 

Demo RAG App for Oracle Cloud Generative AI. No longer being developed. 

## Overview of the App

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a chat engine that will retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query

## Live Demo App

No longer live. Please see https://github.com/cgpavlakos/genai_agent/ for an improved version.

6. Use run.sh to run the demo again after you have already created it


## Instructions for other SEs: 

1. Create VM using Canonical Ubuntu 22.04 platform image
